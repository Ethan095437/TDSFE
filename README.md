The present study proposes a novel temporal dual-stream feature extraction neural network (TDSFE-Net) to address the aforementioned challenges. TDSFE-Net comprises two parallel temporal branches: (1) a hierarchical temporal-separable convolutional network (TSCN) branch incorporating dynamic fusion weight Î± and a local-global attention mechanism (LG-TSCN), and (2) a hybrid branch combining bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) with squeeze-and-excitation network (SENet) (SE-Bi-LSTM). This model integrates LG-TSCN with SE-Bi-LSTM in an end-to-end learning framework, dynamically focusing on activity changes across different levels and accurately classify depression patients and healthy controls. The model is evaluated on various datasets to demonstrate its generalizability and robustness. Additionally, this research explores the correlation between brain regions and depression, providing a scientific basis for early diagnosis and personalized treatment.
